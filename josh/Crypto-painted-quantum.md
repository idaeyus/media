# Crypto painted Quantum

Quantum cryptography seems a little niche, but the name is self explanatory when it comes to defining quantum cryptography. It's cryptography painted quantum. A more formal and definitive version of saying what quantum cryptography is is that  "Quantum cryptography (also known as quantum encryption) refers to various cybersecurity methods for encrypting and transmitting secure data based on the naturally occurring and immutable laws of quantum mechanics."(IBM, 2023)

Like IBM says-"particles are inherently  uncertain. On a quantum level, particles can simultaneously exist in more than one place or in more than one state of being at the same time. And it is impossible to predict their exact quantum state. "

The spin and polarity on photons (the smallest particles of light) are used to represent the binary counterparts of classical systems. The act of measuring a quantum system always entails altering the system to a measurable effect.

No quantum particle can be cloned 1:1, only some properties of particles can be cloned.

Quantum cryptography is based on these principles of quantum mechanics.

There are two types of cryptosystem, symmetric and asymmetric systems, both use a key to encrypt and decrypt the data, symmetric systems use a secret key to encrypt and decrypt data, asymmetric systems use a public key anyone can read or a private key that that is accessed only by authorized individuals or parties.  Ogh keys are created by multiplying large orders of prime numbers, the security relies on the computing power needed to crack an integer of that magnitude.

Even if there are eavesdroppers, unauthorized individuals or groups, the amount of computing power needed to read the key would fry the computer. 
There are some types of quantum cryptography, one called Quantum Key Distribution.

Originally the brainchild of Charles H. Bennet in 1984, the same year as George Orwell's pleasant story was set in. QKD systems use a shared secure key which can also be used in turn for symmetric key encryption. Given that observing a quantum system always comes with altering the system, any eavesdroppers would be noticed by their measurable alteration to the system.  

Quantum coin flipping is what happens when two parties don't trust each other but grunt and work together. Two people live in seperate areas, one of them flips a coin over the phone, but can lie about the coin toss. To make sure that doesn't happen, the coin flipping party sends a polarized photon in an uncertain state of heads, tails or both.(similar to Schr√∂dinger's cat) Making a measurement introduces a certainty in the state, thus the other party makes their measurement. 

But their measurement causes an alteration, an addition of randomness in the system. The other party measures this again, getting a certain outcome, thus catching the lying party red-handed.
