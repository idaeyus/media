AI Has Changed the Way We Code

You no longer need to understand how app routes work to make a social media app. You no longer have to visit Stack Overflow to discuss a problem or error.

Now, it's just about writing a prompt to an LLM and watching it generate all the code for you. Describe what you want, and watch the magic unfold.

But as Programmers, What Makes Us Special?

Our ability to thrive in both the creative and logical domains sets us apart. In this world of AI, is it really about knowing the syntax of a language? In my opinion, it isn't. Trust me — and I'm saying this as a programmer myself — you will still be respected if you have a great idea and logical thinking. If you've ever programmed in your life, you probably have the "logical" part covered. But what about creativity? Can you come up with good ideas?

A "good" idea isn't necessarily something that will change the world. A "good" idea is something that helps people. Your idea doesn't need to serve the majority; if it helps even a niche audience, it is still good. If you have the skill of coming up with ideas worth spending time on, you are already ahead of the curve. As of today, LLMs still provide mediocre ideas. Sure, they might occasionally come up with something interesting, but rarely something worth pursuing. They can be a good starting point, but you, as someone capable of ideating, are much more efficient.

But What If You Can't Come Up with Such an Idea?

That's completely fine. Not everyone can. If it isn't the idea that will set you apart, then it is your logic. How strong is your logical thinking? Can you write a simple function to print the Fibonacci series? If not, this is an area you can improve upon. It's much easier to amplify logical thinking than creative thinking. And if you can think logically, you are already on par with the curve, if not slightly ahead.

Conclusion

In the present and the future, your ability to write code in any specific syntax will not be what earns respect.

Respect comes from two things: ideas and logic.
